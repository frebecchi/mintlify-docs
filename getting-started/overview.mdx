## Overview

Reach is a comprehensive Telegram outreach automation platform designed to help you manage campaigns, leads, deals, and customer relationships efficiently. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A valid email address for account registration
- At least one Telegram account (phone number or QR code access)
- Basic understanding of Telegram messaging

## First Steps

### 1. Create Your Account

Sign up for Reach using your email address. You'll receive a verification email to confirm your account.

### 2. Connect Your First Telegram Account

Before creating campaigns, you need to connect at least one Telegram account. You can do this in two ways:

- **Phone Authentication**: Enter your phone number and verify with a code sent to Telegram
- **QR Code Authentication**: Generate a QR code and scan it with your Telegram app

<Note>
  For detailed instructions on connecting Telegram accounts, see our [Telegram Accounts guide](/accounts/overview).
