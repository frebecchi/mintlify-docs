2. Create a secure password
3. Check your email for the verification link
4. Click the verification link to activate your account

### Signing In

Use your email and password to sign in to Reach. If you forget your password, use the password reset feature.

## Profile Management

Access your profile settings from the user menu in the top-right corner of the interface.

### Profile Settings
