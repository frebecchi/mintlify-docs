## Best Practices

1. **Plan Before Creating**: Think about what data you need and how it will be used
2. **Use Appropriate Types**: Choose types that match your data (dropdown for limited options, text for open-ended)
3. **Keep It Simple**: Don't create too many fields - focus on essential data
4. **Use Descriptions**: Help team members understand what to enter
5. **Set Required Sparingly**: Only require truly essential fields
6. **Use Dropdowns**: Limit options with dropdown/multiselect for consistency
7. **Regular Review**: Deactivate unused fields, remove obsolete ones
