## Lead List Page

The leads list displays all accessible leads in a paginated table with comprehensive filtering and search capabilities.

### View Modes

**My Leads** (default):
- Shows only leads you created or imported
- Available to all users
- Fastest loading for personal workspaces

**All Organization Leads**:
- Shows all leads from organization members
- Available to Owners and Admins
- Members can access if organization settings allow
- Includes creator information for filtering

### Pagination

- **Default**: 50 leads per page
- **Maximum**: 1000 leads per page
- **Navigation**: Page numbers and quick jump
- **Performance**: Large page sizes may slow loading

### Sorting

Sort by any column:
- **Created Date**: Newest first (default)
- **Updated Date**: Recently modified
- **Name**: Alphabetical (first_name, last_name)
- **Status**: Active → Blocked → Archived
- **Priority**: High → Medium → Low
- **Source**: Grouped by origin

Sort order can be toggled (ascending/descending).

## Search

Search across multiple fields simultaneously:
- First name and last name
- Username (without @)
- Phone number (partial matches)
- Group name
- Custom field values

Search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings. Results update as you type (debounced for performance).

## Filters

Apply multiple filters to narrow results:

### Status Filter
- **Active**: Available for campaigns
- **Blocked**: Cannot receive messages
- **Archived**: Inactive leads

### Source Filter
- **Manual**: Added through interface
- **Crawling**: Extracted from groups
- **File Upload**: Imported from CSV/Excel
- **Campaign**: Created from interactions
- **Telegram Crawling**: From group extraction

### Priority Filter
- **High**: Important leads
- **Medium**: Standard priority
- **Low**: Lower priority

### Group Filter
Filter by Telegram group/channel name where lead was found.

### Custom Field Filters
Filter by any custom field value (dropdown, multiselect, text, etc.).

### From Crawling

After crawling Telegram groups, select leads from results and save them. See [Crawling Guide](/leads/crawling) for details.

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Selection

- Select individual leads with checkboxes
- Select all visible leads
- Selection persists across pages (stored in localStorage)

### Bulk Edit

Update multiple leads simultaneously:

1. Select leads to update
2. Click **"Bulk Edit"**
3. Choose fields to update:
   - Status
   - Priority
   - Tags (add or remove)
   - Custom fields
4. Apply changes

**Limitations:**
- Cannot bulk edit contact identifiers (username, phone)
- Changes apply to all selected leads
- Operation is logged in activity history

### Bulk Delete

Delete multiple leads at once:

1. Select leads
2. Click **"Delete"** in bulk actions
3. Confirm deletion

**Warning**: Deletion is permanent and removes:
- Lead record
- Campaign participation history

- Deal associations
- Custom field values

Consider archiving instead if you may need data later.

## Editing Leads

### Single Lead Edit

1. Click on lead row to open detail page
2. Click **"Edit"** in sidebar
3. Modify fields
4. Save changes

**Editable Fields:**
- Contact information (name, username, phone)
- Status and priority
- Tags
- Custom fields
- Notes

**Permissions:**
- **Own Leads**: Full edit access
- **Organization Leads**: Any member can edit
- **Deletion**: Only creator or Owner/Admin

### Activity Tracking

All edits are logged in the lead's activity history:
- Who made the change
- What changed (field name and old/new values)
- When the change occurred

## Export

Export leads to CSV:

1. Apply filters/search if needed
2. Click **"Export"** button
3. CSV downloads with current view/filters applied

**Exported Columns:**
- first_name, last_name
- username, phone_number
- status, source
- created_at
- Custom fields (if any)

Export respects current view mode (own vs all organization leads).

## Organization Permissions

### View Access

**Own Leads:**
- Always visible to creator
- Default view for all members

**Organization Leads:**
- **Owner/Admin**: Can view all organization leads
- **Member**: Can view if organization settings allow
- Filter by creator available

### Edit Access

**Own Leads:**
- Full edit permissions for creator
- Can delete own leads

**Organization Leads:**
- **Any Member**: Can edit any organization lead
- **Deletion**: Only creator or Owner/Admin can delete

This collaborative editing model allows team members to update lead information as they work with contacts.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Consistent Naming**: Standardize first_name/last_name format
2. **Leverage Tags**: Create meaningful tag system for quick filtering
3. **Set Priorities**: Mark high-value leads for focused attention
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep lead information current as relationships develop
5. **Archive Instead of Delete**: Preserve historical data for analysis
6. **Use Custom Fields**: Track business-specific information
7. **Monitor Blocked Status**: High blocked rates may indicate messaging issues
