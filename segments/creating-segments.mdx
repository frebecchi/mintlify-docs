## Step-by-Step Creation

### Step 1: Basic Information

#### Segment Name

Enter a descriptive name for your segment. Good segment names:
- Clearly identify the segment's purpose
- Are easy to remember
- Help team members understand the segment

**Examples:**
- "High Priority Leads"
- "Campaign A Participants"
- "US-Based Leads"
- "Responded Last Week"

#### Description

Optionally add a description explaining:
- Segment purpose
- Why leads are included
- How the segment is used
- Notes for your team

#### Color

Choose a color to visually identify the segment:
- Click the color picker
- Select a color
- Or enter a hex color code
- Color appears in segment list and badges

<Info>
  Use colors to visually organize segments. For example, use green for high-priority segments and blue for geographic segments.
</Info>

### Step 2: Add Rules

Rules define which leads belong to the segment. A lead must match ALL rules to be included.

#### Adding a Rule

1. Click **"Add Rule"** button
2. Select the field to check
3. Choose the operator
4. Enter the value
5. Rule is added to the segment

#### Rule Components

**Field:**
- What to check (source, status, custom field, etc.)
- Select from dropdown
- Includes standard and custom fields

**Operator:**
- How to compare (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
- Available operators depend on field type
- Select from dropdown

**Value:**
- What to compare against
- Enter value or select from options
- Format depends on field type

#### Multiple Rules

Add multiple rules to create complex segments:
- All rules must match (AND logic)
- Each rule narrows the segment
- More rules = more specific segment

**Example:**
- Rule 1: Source equals "Campaign A"
- Rule 2: Status equals "Active"
- Rule 3: Custom field "Priority" equals "High"
- Result: Active leads from Campaign A with High priority

### Step 3: Review and Save

Before saving, review:
- Segment name and description
- All rules are correct
- Rule values are accurate
- Color is appropriate

Click **"Create Segment"** to save. The segment will:
- Be created immediately
- Start calculating membership
- Show member count when ready
- Be available for campaigns

## Rule Examples

### Simple Rules

**Source-based:**
- Field: Source
- Operator: Equals
- Value: "Campaign A"

**Status-based:**

- Value: "Active"

**Tag-based:**
- Field: Tags
- Operator: Contains
- Value: "VIP"

### Date-based Rules

- Field: Created Date
- Operator: After
- Value: "2024-01-01"

**Last Contact:**
- Field: Last Contact
- Operator: Before
- Value: "2024-12-31"

### Custom Field Rules

## Complex Segments

### Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple rules for precise targeting:

- Rule 1: Country equals "US"
- Rule 2: Custom Field "Revenue" greater than "50000"
- Rule 3: Status equals "Active"
- Rule 4: Tags contains "Enterprise"

### Date Ranges

Use date rules for time-based segments:

**Example: Recent Leads**
- Rule 1: Created Date after "2024-01-01"
- Rule 2: Created Date before "2024-12-31"

Or use "Between" operator:
- Field: Created Date
- Operator: Between
- Value: "2024-01-01"
- Value 2: "2024-12-31"

## Testing Segments

### After Creation

Once created, segments automatically:
- Calculate initial membership
- Show member count
- Update as lead data changes

### Verify Membership

1. Expand the segment
2. View member list
3. Check if expected leads are included
4. Verify rules are working correctly

### Adjust Rules

If membership doesn't match expectations:
1. Edit the segment
2. Review rules
3. Adjust rule values
4. Refresh segment
5. Verify again

## Tips for Creating Segments

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic rules, add complexity as needed
2. **Test Rules**: Verify rules match expected leads
3. **Use Descriptions**: Document segment purpose
4. **Name Clearly**: Use descriptive names
5. **Review Regularly**: Update segments as needs change
6. **Monitor Size**: Watch segment size for performance

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too Many Rules**: Over-complicating segments
2. **Wrong Operators**: Using incorrect operators for field types
3. **Missing Values**: Not entering rule values
4. **Unclear Names**: Using vague segment names
5. **Not Testing**: Not verifying membership after creation
