## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic rules
2. **Test Rules**: Verify rules match expected leads
3. **Use Appropriate Operators**: Match operators to field types
4. **Combine Carefully**: Multiple rules narrow segments
5. **Document Rules**: Explain complex rule logic
6. **Review Regularly**: Update rules as needs change

## Troubleshooting

### Rule Not Matching

If rules don't match expected leads:

1. Check field values match exactly
2. Verify operator is correct for field type
3. Check case sensitivity
4. Review date formats
5. Test with single rule first

### Segment Too Large

If segment includes too many leads:

1. Add more restrictive rules
2. Use "Not Equals" or "Not Contains"
3. Combine with date restrictions
4. Add custom field filters

### Segment Too Small

If segment includes too few leads:

1. Remove restrictive rules
2. Use "Contains" instead of "Equals"
3. Use "In" for multiple values
4. Check rule values are correct
