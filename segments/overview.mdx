## What are Segments?

Segments are dynamic lists of leads that automatically update based on rules and conditions you define. When leads match segment rules, they're automatically added to the segment. When they no longer match, they're removed.

## How Segments Work

### Dynamic Membership

Segments automatically include or exclude leads based on:
- **Rules**: Conditions that leads must meet
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes as lead data changes
- **Automatic Refresh**: Regular updates to membership

### Rule-Based

Segments use rules to determine membership:
- **Field**: What to check (source, status, custom field, etc.)
- **Operator**: How to compare (equals, contains, greater than, etc.)
- **Value**: What to compare against

### Multiple Rules

Segments can have multiple rules:
- All rules must match (AND logic)
- Leads matching all rules are included
- Flexible rule combinations

## Segment Components

### Basic Information

**Segment Name:**
- Descriptive name identifying the segment
- Shown in segment list
- Used when selecting segments for campaigns

**Description:**
- Optional explanation of segment purpose
- Helps team understand segment goals
- Useful for documentation

**Color:**
- Visual identifier for the segment
- Shown in segment list and badges
- Helps distinguish segments

### Rules

Rules define segment membership:

**Rule Structure:**
- **Field**: What to check
- **Operator**: Comparison method
- **Value**: Comparison value

**Example Rules:**
- Source equals "Campaign A"
- Status equals "Active"
- Custom field "Priority" equals "High"
- Created date after "2024-01-01"

### Membership

**Member Count:**
- Number of leads currently in segment
- Updates automatically
- Shown in segment list

**Members:**
- List of leads in the segment
- Can be viewed and exported
- Updates as rules change

## Segment Status

### Active

Segments that are:
- Currently active
- Updating membership
- Available for campaigns
- Showing member count

### Inactive

Segments that are:
- Temporarily disabled
- Not updating membership

<Info>
  Inactive segments preserve their current membership but don't update automatically. Reactivate to resume updates.
