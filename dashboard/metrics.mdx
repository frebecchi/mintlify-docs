## Metric Categories

The Reach dashboard displays metrics in three main categories: Leads, Messages, and Deals.

## Lead Metrics

### Total Leads

The total number of leads in your system, including:
- Leads imported from CSV or other sources
- Leads added manually
- Leads created from campaign interactions
- Leads from all segments

<Info>
  This metric includes all leads regardless of their status (active, blocked, etc.).
</Info>

### Active Leads

Leads that are currently:
- Included in active campaigns
- Not blocked
- Not archived
- Available for outreach

### New Leads

Leads added within the selected time period. This helps you track:
- Lead growth over time
- Effectiveness of lead generation efforts
- Campaign performance in attracting new leads

### Blocked Leads

Leads who have blocked your Telegram account. This metric helps you:
- Monitor account health
- Identify potential issues with messaging

</Warning>

## Message Metrics

### Messages Sent

Total count of messages sent through all campaigns. This includes:

- No delivery errors occurred

<Note>
  Delivery doesn't guarantee the message was read or opened.
</Note>

### Response Rate

The percentage of messages that received a response from the recipient. Calculated as:

```
Response Rate = (Messages with Responses / Messages Sent) × 100
```

<Info>
  A good response rate varies by industry and campaign type. Track your response rate over time to identify trends.
</Info>

### Open Rate

The percentage of messages that were opened by recipients. This metric:
- Requires read receipts to be enabled
- May not be available for all message types
- Helps measure engagement beyond delivery
