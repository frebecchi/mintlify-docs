### Step 3: Enter Verification Code

2. Click **"Verify Code"**
3. If 2FA is enabled, proceed to password step

### Step 4: Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)

If your Telegram account has 2FA enabled:

1. Enter your 2FA password
2. This is your Telegram 2FA password (not account password)
3. Click **"Verify Password"**

<Warning>
  If you don't have your 2FA password, you'll need to reset it through Telegram before adding the account to Reach.
