2. Click **"Generate QR Code"**
3. QR code appears on screen
4. QR code is valid for 30 seconds

1. Open Telegram app on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices** → **Link Desktop Device**
3. Scan the QR code displayed in Reach
4. Confirm on your phone

### Step 4: Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)

If your Telegram account has 2FA enabled:

1. Enter your 2FA password
2. Click **"Confirm 2FA Password"**
3. Authentication completes

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Expired

If QR code expires:
1. Click **"Generate New QR Code"**
2. Scan new code immediately
3. QR codes expire after 30 seconds
4. Generate fresh code if needed

### Cannot Scan

If you cannot scan:
1. Ensure QR code is clearly visible
2. Check camera permissions
3. Try generating new code
4. Use phone authentication instead

### Scanning Doesn't Work

If scanning doesn't authenticate:
1. Verify QR code is fresh (not expired)
2. Check internet connection
3. Ensure Telegram app is updated
4. Try generating new code
5. Use phone authentication as alternative

### 2FA Required

If 2FA password is required:
1. Enter your Telegram 2FA password
2. This is different from account password
3. If forgotten, reset through Telegram
4. Cannot proceed without 2FA password
