## Campaign Creation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Information

#### Campaign Name

Enter a descriptive name for your campaign. This name will be displayed in:
- Campaign list
- Campaign statistics
- Deal source tracking
- Analytics reports

**Best Practices:**
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include date or version if needed
- Make it easy to identify the campaign's purpose

#### Description

Optionally add a description explaining:
- Campaign goals
- Target audience
- Key messaging points
- Notes for your team

#### Telegram Account

Select the Telegram account to use for sending messages. You must:
- Have at least one connected Telegram account
- Select an account from the dropdown
- Ensure the account is healthy and connected

<Warning>
  Campaigns cannot send messages without a selected Telegram account. Make sure your account is connected before creating the campaign.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Build Your Flow

The campaign flow builder is a visual interface for creating your messaging workflow.

#### Start Node

Every campaign begins with a Start Node that defines:

**Start Type:**
- **Immediate**: Campaign starts as soon as it's launched
- **Scheduled**: Campaign starts at a specific date and time

**For Scheduled Campaigns:**
- **Date**: Select the start date
- **Time**: Select the start time
- **Timezone**: Choose the timezone for the scheduled time

<Info>
  Scheduled times are converted to UTC for storage but displayed in your selected timezone.
</Info>

#### Adding Nodes

Click the **"+"** button or use the node palette to add:

**Message Node:**
- Text message content
- Variable placeholders (e.g., {first_name})
- Message formatting

**Delay Node:**
- Wait time between messages
- Delay duration (minutes, hours, days)
- Conditional delays

**Condition Node:**
- Conditional logic based on responses
- Branch to different paths
- Response matching rules

**End Node:**
- Campaign completion point
- Final actions
- Completion tracking

#### Connecting Nodes

- Drag from node outputs to node inputs
- Create sequential flows
- Add conditional branches
- Define flow paths

### Step 3: Configure Messages

#### Message Content

For each Message Node, define:

**Message Text:**
- Plain text messages
- Variable placeholders
- Emojis and special characters

**Variables:**
- `{first_name}`: Lead's first name
- `{last_name}`: Lead's last name
- `{username}`: Telegram username
- `{phone_number}`: Phone number
- Custom field variables

<Info>
  Variables are replaced with actual values when messages are sent. If a variable value is missing, it may be left blank or replaced with a default.
</Info>

#### Message Timing

Configure when messages are sent:
- **Immediate**: Send right away
- **Delayed**: Wait specified time after previous message
- **Scheduled**: Send at specific time

### Step 4: Select Contacts

Choose which contacts receive the campaign:

**Options:**
- **All Leads**: Send to all leads in your account
- **Segment**: Send to a specific segment
- **Manual Selection**: Select individual leads
- **Custom Filter**: Use advanced filters

### Step 5: Review and Save

Before saving, review:

- Campaign name and description
- Flow configuration
- Selected contacts
- Telegram account
- Start type and schedule

Click **"Save"** to create the campaign as a draft, or **"Save and Launch"** to create and immediately start the campaign.

## Campaign Flow Examples

### Simple Sequence

A basic campaign with sequential messages:

1. **Start Node** → Immediate start
2. **Message Node** → Welcome message
3. **Delay Node** → Wait 24 hours
4. **Message Node** → Follow-up message
5. **End Node** → Complete

### Conditional Flow

A campaign with conditional branching:

1. **Start Node** → Immediate start
2. **Message Node** → Initial message
3. **Condition Node** → Check for response
   - **If Response**: Go to Response Path
   - **If No Response**: Go to Follow-up Path
4. **End Node** → Complete

### Scheduled Campaign

A campaign that starts at a specific time:

1. **Start Node** → Scheduled for specific date/time
2. **Message Node** → Announcement message
3. **End Node** → Complete

## Tips for Creating Campaigns

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic sequential campaigns before adding complexity
2. **Test Flow**: Review your flow visually before saving
3. **Use Variables**: Personalize messages with lead information
4. **Add Delays**: Space out messages to avoid overwhelming recipients
5. **Test First**: Create test campaigns with small audiences
6. **Document**: Add descriptions explaining your campaign strategy

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing Start Node**: Every campaign needs a Start Node
2. **No Connections**: Ensure nodes are properly connected
3. **Missing Account**: Don't forget to select a Telegram account
4. **No Contacts**: Make sure contacts are selected
5. **Invalid Schedule**: Check scheduled times are in the future
6. **Complex Flows**: Start simple and add complexity gradually
