## Bulk Operations Overview

Bulk operations allow you to perform actions on multiple campaigns simultaneously, saving time when managing many campaigns. All operations respect organization context and role-based permissions.

## Selecting Campaigns

### Individual Selection

Select campaigns individually by clicking the checkbox next to each campaign in the list.

**Selection Behavior:**
- Checkbox toggles selection state
- Selected campaigns highlighted
- Selection persists during filtering/searching
- Cleared after bulk operation completes

### Select All

Use the checkbox in the table header to select all visible campaigns.

**Scope:**
- Selects all campaigns currently displayed
- Respects current filters and search
- Does not select campaigns on other pages (pagination)
- Does not select campaigns not visible (filtered out)

**Limitations:**
- Only selects campaigns you can see (based on permissions)
- In organization mode: Only selects campaigns you have access to
- In personal mode: Only selects your own campaigns

### Deselecting

**Methods:**
- Click individual checkboxes to deselect
- Click header checkbox again to deselect all
- Use "Clear Selection" button in bulk actions bar
- Selection cleared automatically after bulk operation

## Bulk Actions Bar

When campaigns are selected, a bulk actions bar appears showing:

**Information:**
- Number of selected campaigns
- Available bulk actions (based on selection)
- Clear selection button

**Actions Available:**
- Enable (if any disabled)
- Disable (if any enabled)
- Launch (if any draft/paused)
- Stop (if any active)
- Delete (if permitted)

**Permissions:**
- Actions only shown if you have permissions
- Some actions may be disabled based on campaign status
- Error messages shown for unauthorized operations

## Available Bulk Operations

### Enable Campaigns

Enable multiple disabled campaigns at once.

**Requirements:**
- Selected campaigns must be disabled (`enabled = false`)
- You must have edit permissions for all selected campaigns
- Campaigns can be in any status

**Process:**
1. Select disabled campaigns
2. Click "Enable" in bulk actions bar
3. Each campaign's `enabled` flag set to `true`
4. Campaigns can now be launched (if status allows)

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Can enable own campaigns
- Admin: Can enable own campaigns
- Member: Can enable own campaigns
- Owner/Admin: Can enable other members' campaigns (if can edit)
- Member: Cannot enable other members' campaigns

**Results:**
- Success count: Number of campaigns successfully enabled
- Error count: Number of campaigns that failed
- Error details: Specific errors for failed campaigns

### Disable Campaigns

Disable multiple campaigns to prevent launching and stop active executions.

**Requirements:**
- Selected campaigns can be in any status
- You must have edit permissions for all selected campaigns

**Process:**
1. Select campaigns to disable
2. Click "Disable" in bulk actions bar
3. Each campaign's `enabled` flag set to `false`
4. All active executions cancelled immediately
5. Campaigns cannot be launched until re-enabled

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Can disable own campaigns
- Admin: Can disable own campaigns
- Member: Can disable own campaigns
- Owner/Admin: Can disable other members' campaigns (if can edit)
- Member: Cannot disable other members' campaigns

**Impact:**
- Active executions cancelled immediately
- Campaigns cannot be launched
- Different from pause (cannot launch when disabled)

**Results:**
- Success count: Number of campaigns successfully disabled
- Cancelled executions: Total executions cancelled across all campaigns
- Error count: Number of campaigns that failed

### Launch Campaigns

Start multiple campaigns simultaneously.

**Requirements:**
- Selected campaigns must be in `draft` or `paused` status
- Campaigns must be enabled (`enabled = true`)

- At least one contact selected per campaign
- You must have launch permissions for all selected campaigns

**Process:**
1. Select campaigns in `draft` or `paused` status
2. Click "Launch" in bulk actions bar
3. Each campaign's status changes to `active` (or `scheduled` if scheduled)
4. Paused executions resume
5. Completed executions reset (if applicable)
6. Workers pick up executions on next cycle

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Can launch own campaigns
- Admin: Can launch own campaigns
- Member: Can launch own campaigns
- Cannot launch other members' campaigns (even with view access)

**Status Handling:**
- `draft` → `active` (or `scheduled`)
- `paused` → `active`
- Other statuses skipped with error message

**Results:**
- Success count: Number of campaigns successfully launched
- Skipped count: Number of campaigns skipped (wrong status)
- Error count: Number of campaigns that failed

### Stop Campaigns

Stop multiple active campaigns immediately.

**Requirements:**
- Selected campaigns must be `active` or `paused`
- You must have stop permissions for all selected campaigns

**Process:**
1. Select active or paused campaigns
2. Click "Stop" in bulk actions bar
3. Confirm the stop action
4. Each campaign's status changes to `cancelled`
5. All active executions cancelled immediately
6. Progress lost (cannot resume)

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Can stop own campaigns
- Admin: Can stop own campaigns
- Member: Can stop own campaigns
- Owner/Admin: Can stop other members' campaigns (if can edit)
- Member: Cannot stop other members' campaigns

**Impact:**
- All active executions cancelled
- Progress lost (cannot resume)
- Must duplicate to restart

**Results:**
- Success count: Number of campaigns successfully stopped
- Cancelled executions: Total executions cancelled across all campaigns
- Error count: Number of campaigns that failed

### Delete Campaigns

Permanently remove multiple campaigns (soft delete).

**Requirements:**
- Selected campaigns can be in any status (except `active` - must stop first)
- You must have delete permissions for all selected campaigns

**Process:**
1. Select campaigns to delete
2. Click "Delete" in bulk actions bar
3. Confirm the deletion
4. Each campaign's `deleted_at` timestamp set
5. Campaigns hidden from list (soft delete)
6. Statistics and logs preserved

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Can delete own campaigns
- Admin: Can delete own campaigns
- Member: Can delete own campaigns
- Owner/Admin: Can delete other members' campaigns
- Member: Cannot delete other members' campaigns

**Status Restrictions:**
- `active` campaigns must be stopped first
- Other statuses can be deleted directly

**Results:**
- Success count: Number of campaigns successfully deleted
- Skipped count: Number of campaigns skipped (active status)
- Error count: Number of campaigns that failed

## Bulk Operation Results

After performing a bulk operation, you'll see:

**Success Message:**
- Number of campaigns successfully processed
- Summary of operation results
- Updated status for affected campaigns

**Error Message:**
- Number of campaigns that couldn't be processed
- Specific errors for each failed campaign
- Reasons for failures (permissions, status, etc.)

**Updated Status:**
- Campaigns reflect their new status
- Selection automatically cleared
- List refreshed to show changes

**Partial Success:**
- If some campaigns fail, operation continues for remaining campaigns
- Check error messages for details
- Retry failed campaigns individually if needed

## Limitations

### Operation Limits

**Batch Processing:**
- Bulk operations process campaigns in batches
- Large selections may take time to process
- Progress indicator shown for long operations

**Rate Limits:**
- Some operations may have rate limits
- Large bulk operations may be throttled
- Wait between operations if rate limited

**Timeout:**
- Operations timeout after 60 seconds
- Large selections may need to be split
- Use smaller batches if timeout occurs

### Status Restrictions

**Enable/Disable:**
- Works on any status
- No status restrictions

**Launch:**
- Only `draft` and `paused` campaigns
- Other statuses skipped with error

**Stop:**
- Only `active` and `paused` campaigns
- Other statuses skipped with error

**Delete:**
- Any status except `active` (must stop first)
- `active` campaigns skipped with error

### Permission Restrictions

**Own Campaigns:**
- All roles can perform bulk operations on own campaigns
- Subject to status restrictions

**Other Members' Campaigns:**
- Owner: Can perform bulk operations (subject to status)
- Admin: Can perform bulk operations (subject to status)
- Member: Cannot perform bulk operations on other members' campaigns

**Mixed Selection:**
- If selection includes campaigns you cannot edit:
  - Operation fails for unauthorized campaigns
  - Authorized campaigns processed successfully
  - Error message shows which campaigns failed

### Organization Context

**Personal Mode:**
- Only your own campaigns visible
- No organization campaigns in selection
- Complete isolation

**Organization Mode:**
- Selection respects view mode (`own` vs `all`)
- `own` mode: Only your campaigns selectable
- `all` mode: All organization campaigns selectable (Owner/Admin only)
- Members cannot select other members' campaigns

## Best Practices

### Before Bulk Operations

1. **Review Selection**: Double-check which campaigns are selected
2. **Verify Status**: Ensure campaigns are in correct status for operation
3. **Check Permissions**: Verify you have permissions for all selected campaigns
4. **Backup Important**: Consider duplicating important campaigns before bulk delete
5. **Test First**: Try bulk operations on small group first

### During Bulk Operations

1. **Wait for Completion**: Don't navigate away during bulk operations
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for success/error messages
3. **Check Results**: Verify campaigns were processed correctly
4. **Handle Errors**: Review error messages and retry if needed

### After Bulk Operations

1. **Review Changes**: Check that campaigns have expected status
2. **Verify Results**: Confirm operation achieved your goals
3. **Document**: Note what was changed and why
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any unexpected behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Bulk Operation Fails

**Check:**
1. Selected campaigns are in correct status
2. You have permissions for all selected campaigns
3. Campaigns are not locked by another process
4. Requirements met (contacts, accounts, etc.)

**Solutions:**
- Verify permissions and status
- Try smaller batches
- Check error messages for details
- Retry failed campaigns individually

### Some Campaigns Not Processed

**Check:**
1. Their status (may not be eligible)
2. Your permissions (may not have access)
3. Requirements (contacts, accounts, etc.)

**Solutions:**
- Review error messages
- Check campaign status individually
- Verify permissions
- Try processing them individually

### Selection Cleared Unexpectedly

**Behavior:**
- Selection cleared automatically after bulk operation
- This is normal behavior
- Re-select campaigns if needed

**Solutions:**
- Re-select campaigns for next operation
- Use filters to narrow down campaigns
- Check if page was refreshed

### Timeout Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Operation times out after 60 seconds
- Large selections fail

**Solutions:**
- Split selection into smaller batches
- Process campaigns in groups
- Use individual operations for large sets

## Use Cases

- Old test campaigns
- Completed campaigns no longer needed
- Duplicate campaigns
- Failed campaigns

**Process:**
1. Filter campaigns to clean up
2. Select all visible campaigns
3. Bulk delete
4. Confirm deletion

### Campaign Launch

Use bulk launch to:
- Start multiple campaigns at once
- Launch scheduled campaigns together
- Resume multiple paused campaigns

**Process:**
1. Filter campaigns to launch
2. Select campaigns in `draft` or `paused` status
3. Bulk launch
4. Monitor progress

### Campaign Management

Use bulk enable/disable to:
- Temporarily disable multiple campaigns
- Enable campaigns after maintenance
- Manage campaign availability

**Process:**
1. Select campaigns to manage
2. Bulk enable or disable
3. Verify status changes

### Emergency Stop

Use bulk stop to:
- Stop multiple problematic campaigns

- Cancel executions across campaigns

**Process:**
1. Filter active campaigns
2. Select all active campaigns
3. Bulk stop
4. Confirm stop action
