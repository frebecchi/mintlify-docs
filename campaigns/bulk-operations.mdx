## Bulk Operations Overview

Bulk operations allow you to perform actions on multiple campaigns simultaneously, saving time when managing many campaigns.

## Selecting Campaigns

### Individual Selection

Select campaigns individually by clicking the checkbox next to each campaign in the list.

### Select All

Use the checkbox in the table header to select all visible campaigns. This selects:
- All campaigns currently displayed
- Respects current filters and search
- Does not select campaigns on other pages

### Deselecting

- Click individual checkboxes to deselect
- Click the header checkbox again to deselect all
- Use the "Clear" button in the bulk actions bar

## Bulk Actions Bar

When campaigns are selected, a bulk actions bar appears showing:
- Number of selected campaigns
- Available bulk actions
- Clear selection button

## Bulk Operation Results

After performing a bulk operation, you'll see:

- **Success Message**: Number of campaigns successfully processed
- **Error Message**: Any campaigns that couldn't be processed
- **Updated Status**: Campaigns reflect their new status
- **Selection Cleared**: Checkboxes are automatically cleared

<Info>
  If some campaigns fail, the operation continues for the remaining campaigns. Check error messages for details.
</Info>

## Best Practices

### Before Bulk Operations

1. **Review Selection**: Double-check which campaigns are selected
2. **Verify Status**: Ensure campaigns are in the correct status for the operation
3. **Backup Important**: Consider duplicating important campaigns before bulk delete
4. **Test First**: Try bulk operations on a small group first

### During Bulk Operations

1. **Wait for Completion**: Don't navigate away during bulk operations
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for success/error messages
3. **Check Results**: Verify campaigns were processed correctly

### After Bulk Operations

1. **Review Changes**: Check that campaigns have the expected status
2. **Verify Results**: Confirm the operation achieved your goals
3. **Document**: Note what was changed and why

## Limitations

### Operation Limits

- Bulk operations process campaigns in batches
- Large selections may take time to process
- Some operations may have rate limits

### Status Restrictions

- **Enable/Disable**: Works on any status
- **Launch**: Only Draft and Paused campaigns
- **Stop**: Only Active campaigns
- **Delete**: Any status except Active (must stop first)

### Permission Restrictions

- You can only perform bulk operations on campaigns you created
- Organization admins/owners may have additional permissions
- Some operations require specific permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Bulk Operation Fails

If bulk operations fail:

1. Check selected campaigns are in correct status
2. Verify you have permissions
3. Ensure campaigns are not locked
4. Try smaller batches
5. Check for error messages

### Some Campaigns Not Processed

If some campaigns aren't processed:

1. Check their status (may not be eligible)
2. Verify permissions
3. Review error messages
4. Try processing them individually

### Selection Cleared Unexpectedly

If selection is cleared:

1. This is normal after bulk operations
2. Re-select campaigns if needed
3. Use filters to narrow down campaigns
4. Check if page was refreshed

## Use Cases

### Campaign Cleanup

Use bulk delete to clean up:
- Old test campaigns
- Completed campaigns no longer needed
- Duplicate campaigns
- Failed campaigns

### Campaign Launch

Use bulk launch to:
- Start multiple campaigns at once
- Launch scheduled campaigns together
- Resume multiple paused campaigns

### Campaign Management

Use bulk enable/disable to:
- Temporarily disable multiple campaigns
- Enable campaigns after maintenance
- Manage campaign availability
