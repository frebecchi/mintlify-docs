## What are Campaigns?

Campaigns are automated messaging workflows that send messages to your leads through Telegram. A campaign defines:

- **Target Audience**: Which leads or segments to contact
- **Message Flow**: The sequence of messages and actions
- **Sending Schedule**: When and how messages are sent
- **Telegram Account**: Which account to use for sending

## Campaign Components

### Campaign Name

A descriptive name for your campaign. Use names that clearly identify the campaign's purpose, such as:
- "Product Launch - Q1 2024"
- "Welcome Sequence - New Users"
- "Follow-up - No Response"

### Description

Optional description providing additional context about the campaign. Useful for:
- Documenting campaign goals
- Notes for team members
- Campaign history

### Telegram Account

The Telegram account used to send messages. You must:
- Connect at least one Telegram account before creating campaigns
- Select which account to use for each campaign
- Ensure the account is healthy and connected

<Warning>
  Campaigns cannot send messages if the associated Telegram account is disconnected or unhealthy.
