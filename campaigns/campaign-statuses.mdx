## Troubleshooting Status Issues

### Campaign Stuck in Active

If a campaign appears stuck in Active status:

1. Check if messages are actually being sent
2. Review campaign statistics
3. Check Telegram account health
4. Try pausing and resuming
5. Contact support if needed

### Cannot Change Status

If you cannot change a campaign status:

1. Verify you have permission (must be creator or admin/owner)
2. Check if campaign is enabled
3. Ensure Telegram account is connected
4. Try refreshing the page
5. Check for system notifications

### Status Not Updating

If status doesn't update as expected:

1. Refresh the page
2. Check network connection
3. Wait a few moments for status to sync
4. Review campaign logs if available
5. Contact support if issue persists

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Status**: Regularly check campaign statuses
2. **Use Pause**: Pause instead of stopping when you need to temporarily halt
3. **Plan Schedules**: Use scheduled status for planned campaigns
4. **Track Completion**: Monitor campaigns approaching completion
5. **Document Changes**: Note why status changes were made
