## What are Sequences?

Sequences are reusable message templates that define a series of messages with delays between them. Use sequences in campaigns to create consistent messaging workflows.

## Sequence Components

### Sequence Structure

A sequence consists of:
- **Sequence Name**: Descriptive name
- **Steps**: Individual messages and delays
- **Order**: Sequential execution order

### Sequence Steps

**Message Steps:**
- Text content
- Variable placeholders
- Message formatting

**Delay Steps:**
- Wait time between messages
- Duration (minutes, hours, days)
- Configurable delays

## Using Sequences

### In Campaigns

Sequences can be used in campaigns:
- Select sequence when creating campaign
- Sequence steps become campaign flow
- Customize sequence per campaign
- Reuse across multiple campaigns

### Benefits

**Consistency:**
- Standardized messaging
- Reusable templates
- Consistent timing

**Efficiency:**
- Create once, use many times
- Quick campaign setup
- Less repetitive work

**Flexibility:**
- Customize per campaign
- Modify as needed
- Version control

## Creating Sequences

### Basic Steps

1. Click **"Create Sequence"**
2. Enter sequence name
3. Add message steps
4. Add delay steps between messages
5. Configure step content
6. Save sequence

## Sequence Steps

### Message Step

A message to send:
- Text content
- Variable placeholders
- Can include emojis
- Supports formatting

**Variables:**
- `{first_name}`: Lead's first name
- `{last_name}`: Lead's last name
- `{username}`: Telegram username
- Custom field variables

### Delay Step

Wait time between messages:
- Duration in minutes, hours, or days
- Configurable timing
- Ensures proper spacing

**Common Delays:**
- 24 hours between messages
- 3 days for follow-up
- 1 week for final message

## Best Practices

1. **Name Clearly**: Use descriptive sequence names
2. **Test First**: Test sequences before using in campaigns
3. **Use Variables**: Personalize messages with variables
4. **Space Messages**: Add appropriate delays
5. **Keep Updated**: Update sequences as messaging evolves

## Managing Sequences

### View Sequences

See all your sequences:
- Sequence name
- Number of steps
- Created date
- Actions menu

### Edit Sequences

Modify sequence content:
- Update message text
- Adjust delays
- Add or remove steps
- Reorder steps

### Delete Sequences

Remove sequences:
- Permanently delete
- Cannot be undone
- Check for campaign usage first

<Warning>
  Deleting a sequence doesn't affect campaigns already using it, but you won't be able to use it in new campaigns.
</Warning>
