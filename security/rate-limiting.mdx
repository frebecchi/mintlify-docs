## Rate Limiting Overview

Rate limiting helps protect your Telegram accounts by controlling how many messages can be sent per time period, preventing account restrictions and ensuring compliance with Telegram's terms of service.

## Understanding Rate Limits

### Why Rate Limits Matter

Rate limits protect your accounts by:
- Preventing account restrictions from Telegram
- Avoiding spam detection
- Maintaining account health
- Ensuring sustainable outreach

### Types of Limits

**Daily Limits:**
- Maximum messages per day per account
- Resets daily at midnight (account timezone)
- Prevents overuse in single day

**Hourly Limits:**
- Maximum messages per hour per account
- Rolling window (last 60 minutes)
- Prevents burst sending

**Per-Minute Limits:**
- Maximum messages per minute
- Telegram-enforced limits
- Automatic compliance

## Configuring Rate Limits

### Setting Daily Limits

2. Set daily limit value
3. Consider account age and history
4. Save configuration

**Recommended Limits:**
- New accounts: 50-100 messages/day
- Established accounts: 200-500 messages/day
- Varies by account age and Telegram's limits

### Setting Hourly Limits

Configure maximum messages per hour:
1. Select account
2. Set hourly limit value
3. Ensure hourly × 24 doesn't exceed daily limit
4. Save configuration

**Recommended Limits:**
- New accounts: 5-10 messages/hour
- Established accounts: 20-50 messages/hour

## Monitoring Limits

### Usage Tracking

Monitor your usage:
- **Messages Sent Today**: Current daily usage
- **Messages Sent This Hour**: Current hourly usage
- **Remaining Quota**: How many messages left
- **Limit Warnings**: Alerts when approaching limits

### Limit Warnings

Receive warnings when:
- 80% of daily limit reached
- 80% of hourly limit reached
- Limit exceeded
- Account at risk

<Warning>
  Exceeding rate limits may result in temporary account restrictions from Telegram. Monitor usage closely.
</Warning>

## Account-Specific Limits

### Different Limits Per Account

Each account can have different limits:
- **New Accounts**: Lower limits for safety
- **Established Accounts**: Higher limits
- **Account Age**: Older accounts can handle more
- **Account Health**: Healthy accounts can send more

### Adjusting Limits

Gradually increase limits:
1. Start with conservative limits
2. Monitor account health
3. Gradually increase if stable
4. Don't increase too quickly

## Best Practices

### Limit Management

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower limits
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch usage and account health
3. **Increase Gradually**: Slowly raise limits over time
4. **Use Multiple Accounts**: Distribute load across accounts
5. **Respect Warnings**: Heed limit warnings

### Account Protection

1. **Stay Within Limits**: Never exceed configured limits
2. **Monitor Health**: Check account status regularly
3. **Distribute Load**: Use multiple accounts
4. **Watch for Restrictions**: Monitor for Telegram restrictions
5. **Adjust as Needed**: Modify limits based on performance

## Telegram's Limits

### Understanding Telegram Limits

Telegram enforces its own limits:
- Not publicly documented
- Varies by account age
- Varies by account type
- Enforced automatically

### Compliance

Reach helps you comply by:
- Enforcing your configured limits
- Monitoring usage
- Providing warnings
- Preventing violations

## Troubleshooting

### Limit Reached

If you hit a rate limit:
1. Wait for limit to reset (hourly or daily)
2. Check limit configuration
3. Consider increasing limits (gradually)
4. Use additional accounts
5. Distribute message load

### Account Restricted

If Telegram restricts your account:
1. Check rate limit compliance
2. Review account health
3. Wait for restriction to lift (usually 24-48 hours)
4. Reduce sending volume
5. Contact support if persistent

### Limits Too Low

If limits are too restrictive:
1. Gradually increase limits
2. Monitor account health
3. Test with small increases
4. Don't increase too quickly
5. Consider account age
